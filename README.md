## About me
Hi ðŸ‘‹,
my name is Jochen, I'm 19 years old and a german based apprentice for Application Development.
I started my training ship in September 2022 and will finish it in May 2025.

## Skills

I'm learning and also mastering many programming languages and concepts at my current company, including:
- cpp / qt
- python3
- dart / flutter
- next.js
- docker

... but also many other programming languages. But the ones mentioned above are the main thing.
Im also capable of creating RESTful APIs as well as creating standalone applications.

In my company I mostly develop applications with the cpp Framework "Qt" for embedded devices.
But i also wrote some Flutter applications for internal usage as well as websites with python-flask.

At the same time, I plan and develop some Arduino projects in my spare time. Mainly to
to learn new techniques and of course to have fun :D

## Plan

Here on GitHub I am planning some projects that I would like to share with you.
I would not only like to share my ideas with you, but also give one or the other of you a suggestion
or even give you a suggestion to create a new project or extend one of my projects.
