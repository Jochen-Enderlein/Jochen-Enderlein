## About me

Hi ðŸ‘‹,
my name is Jochen, I'm 19 years old and a german based software developer.

## Skills

I'm learning and also mastering many programming languages and concepts at my current company, including:
- cpp / qt
- python3
- dart / flutter
- next.js
- docker

... but also many other programming languages. But the ones mentioned above are the main thing.

## Plan

Here on GitHub I am planning some projects that I would like to share with you.
I would not only like to share my ideas with you, but also give one or the other of you a suggestion
or even give you a suggestion to create a new project or extend one of my projects.
